#' Make an EMST directed and return the depth-first search order
#'
#' Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST) edgelists from
#' [emstreeR::ComputeMST()] aren't directed.  We also need to know a depth-first
#' search order of the nodes, to traverse them in loops rather than by
#' recursion, which would reach the stack limit.  This function does both.  A
#' list is returned containing the modified `edges`, and a `dfs_order` element
#' that names the nodes in depth-first search order.  The `tree` is modified in
#' place.
#'
#' @param `tree` (`environment`) A potentially undirected tree, originally from
#'   [tree_from_edges()].
#' @param `edges` A data frame with one row per edge, and at least the two
#'   `numeric` columns `from` and `to` for the IDs of the nodes being connected
#'   by the edge.  Must be the same as was used by [tree_from_edges()] to create
#'   `tree` from the output of [emstreeR::ComputeMST()].
#' @param `root_id` (`numeric`) The ID of the node to treat as the root.
#'
#' @return
#' A list containing `edges` with some values of the `to` and `from` columns
#' exchanged so that the graph is directed, and `dfs_order`, which is a vector
#' of node IDs in the order that they would be visited in a depth-first search.
#' the `tree` is modified in place, so is not returned.
