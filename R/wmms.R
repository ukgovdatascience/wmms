#' Find the highest possible sum(a)/sum(b) of any subtree
#'
#' This is an exact algorithm to obtain a subtree, connected with the root, that
#' has the highest possible average value per node, which is `sum(a) / sum(b)`
#' of all the edges in the tree that remain after discarding low-value nodes.
#'
#' For details of the algorithm, see the documentation for `wmms`.
#'
#' @param `edges` A data frame of edges of the tree, with at least the columns
#'   `to` and `from` (integer IDs of nodes), and `a` and `b` (numeric).  The
#'   `from` and `to` IDs will be swapped where necessary to ensure that `to` is
#'   the one that is further from the root node.  Then the edge values `a` and
#'   `b` will be treated as belonging to the node rather than to the edge.
#'   Passed to [tree_from_edges()].
#' @param `root_id` (`numeric`) The ID of the root node of the tree.  Passed to
#'   [directed()] and other functions.
#'
#' @return
#' The original `edges` data frame, with the `from` and `to` values swapped
#' where necessary to ensure the edges are directed away from the root node, and
#' with the additional columns:
#'
#' * `ancestor` Of all the nodes that a node's value is averaged with, the ID of
#'   ancestor that is closest to the root.  All the nodes between this edge and
#'   that ancestor have the same average value, and there might be other
#'   descendants of that ancestor that do too.
#' * `value` The average value of all the descendants of the `ancestor` that are
#'   averaged together by `sum(a) / sum(b)`.  An nodes's `value` is less than
#'   `average` if the node isn't part of the maximum subtree. But it is still
#'   the highest possible for that node if it were added to the maximum subtree
#'   with any others in its set.
#'
#'   Because there is still exactly one node per edge, the node values can be
#'   interpreted as edge values again.
