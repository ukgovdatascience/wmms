#' After finding the optimal subtree connected with the root, some subtrees will
#' probably have been pruned.  These are then optimised in their own right,
#' recursively, so that the value of adding the to the optimum subtree is known.
#' To recurse into subtrees, each node keeps a list of its descendants in
#' depth-first search order, so that a depth-first search search doesn't have to
#' be performed for every pruned subtree.  The list is wrapped in an
#' environment, so that when it is passed to functions, the functions can modify
#' it in place.
#'
#' @param `tree` (`environment`) Originally from [directed()].
#' @param `dfs_order` (`character`) A vector of node IDs in depth-first search
#'   order, originally from [directed()].
#'
#' @return
#' No value is returned.  The nodes are modified in place.
