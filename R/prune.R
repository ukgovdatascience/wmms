#' Prune or merge nodes according to their value vs bounds of the true maximum
#'
#' Whereas `value()` simulates greedily pruning the tree to obtain its maximum
#' possible value, this algorithm really prunes the tree, but only when it can
#' be proved that a node is not part of the maximum.  This is part of a process
#' that is repeated until the tree obtains its true maximum.
#'
#' @details
#' * Leaf nodes whose value `a/b` is lower than `bounds$low` are pruned, because
#'   they will not be part of the maximum.
#' * Nodes (not only leaf nodes) whose value `a/b` is equal to or above
#'   `bounds$low`, and below (but not equal to) `bounds$high`, are kept.  They
#'   might yet be part of the maximum.
#' * Nodes (not only leaf nodes) whose value `a/b` is above `bounds$high` are
#'   'merged' into their parent, because they will be part of the maximum.
#' * If a non-leaf node's value `a/b` is lower than `bounds$low`, and it has
#'   exactly one child, then merge the child into this node, and reapply all
#'   these rules, because its value `a/b` has changed and it might now be a
#'   leaf, or have acquired more than one child.  If the only child exists, it
#'   is because its value `a/b` is between the bounds, and might be high enough
#'   to compensate for its parent's low value.
#'
#' To 'merge' a node into is parent:
#'
#' 1. Add the node's value `a` to the parent's value `a`
#' 2. Add the node's value `b` to the parent's value `b`
#' 3. Make any children of the node children of the parent instead.  Such
#'    children exist when their values `a/b` are between the bounds, so they
#'    have neither been pruned, nore been merged into their parent.
#'
#' Once a child has been pruned, it is no longer included in the `children`
#' environment of its parent.  However, the `parent` object of the child still
#' links to the parent, so it is still possible to know which child belonged to
#' which parent in the original tree.  The child still exists because it is
#' still in the the environment that is the overall tree.  It just won't be
#' reached from the root node.
#'
#' @param `tree` (`environment`) The whole tree, originally created by
#'   [tree_from_edges()].
#' @param `bounds` A list of `low` and `high` numeric values between which the
#'   true maximum value of the tree has been sought.  The bounds will initially
#'   be `list(low = -Inf, high = Inf)`.
#' @param `dfs_env` (`environment`) An environment containing an object called
#'   `dfs` that is a named list of `NULL` values, where the names are IDs of
#'   nodes in depth-first order.  Obtained from [set_subtrees()].
#'
#' @return
#' There is no return value. The tree is modified in place.
